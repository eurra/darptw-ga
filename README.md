# Genetic Algorithm (GA) for the DARPTW problem (C#)

This repo contains the source code that I developed for my undergraduate thesis work, in which several Genetic Algorithm implementations where applied for for solving the Dial-a-Ride Problem with Time Windows.

A general explanation of the models, their working internals and obtained results is available in the [following paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220023694_Application_of_Genetic_Algorithms_for_the_DARPTW_Problem#fullTextFileContent).

Note: Code documentation is in spanish.
